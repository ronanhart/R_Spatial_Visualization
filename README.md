**Welcome to the R Spatial and Visualization Workshop!**

(This workshop was originally created for the Utah State University's Ecology Center's R Workshop Series)

## Table of Contents

*Chapter 1: Introduction and Prerequisites*
  

*Chapter 2: Introduction to GIS*

This chapter is recommended if you have never taken any GIS course, it is your first time working with spatial data, or you would like a refresher on the basics of GIS.
  

*Chapter 3: Spatial Data in R*

This chapter is recommended if you have worked with spatial data in other programs or software such as the ArcGIS suite but are unfamiliar with how to load or manipulate spatial data in R.
  

*Chapter 4: Spatial Analysis*

This is the meat of this workshop. This chapter goes over how to perform some spatial analyses you are likely going to use. This is not comprehensive to every possible function or analysis that one might need. 
  

*Chapter 5: Visualization*

Once you've performed your spatial analysis, you likely need to make some nice-looking maps to include in a manuscript or presentation. This chapter goes over some tips and tricks to make your maps a little more visually appealing, such as how to adjust the color palettes, add map elements like a north arrow and scale bar, including an inset, and more.
  

*Chapter 6: Conclusions and Resources*

This brief chapter offers some resources on where to find spatial data you may need in your analyses and where I obtained the data used in the workshop.
  

## Goals of this workshop:

* Reiterate the basics of GIS
* Teach you the processes that you might have learned in ArcGIS or other GIS software that you can code yourself in R
* Teach you some tips and tricks to make pretty maps 

If you would like to follow along, try out some of the examples, and work on some practice exercises, download the file worksheet.R and the data from the Data/Exercises folder.
  

## Notes on Updates

Chapters 4 and 5 are certainly not comprehensive to every function, analysis, or option for performing spatial analysis or creating pretty maps. If you have a suggestion to something specific that either you use often or something you need to use but don't know how to do it in R, please contact me and I am happy to add it!

Please note that this workshop mainly covers how to make maps using `ggplot2` and not base R plotting. It is my goal to one day include these options as well. However, 1) I have only ever plotted and made maps with `ggplot2`, so I will first have to familiarize myself with base R plotting, which may take a bit of time; and 2) I made this in my free-time as a graduate student and now a full-time worker, so updates will happen slowly.
